Here are some current issues with interopability:

1- Line terminators in notes

Password Safe for Windows v3.31, Password Gorilla v1.5.3.6.3 on Ubuntu
13.04 and PasswdSafe for Android create notes with CRLF line terminators,
while Pasaffe creates them with LF line terminators. This doesn't seem to
create an issue, but perhaps Pasaffe should make sure they are CRLF in the
database, and migrate existing entries on import.

2- Missing passwords

Pasaffe used to allow creating entries with no password fields. Password
Gorilla v1.5.3.6.3 on Ubuntu 13.04, and possibly other versions, has no
trouble with missing password fields, but Password Safe for Windows v3.31,
and possibly other versions, gives an error dialog when opening the
database and proceeds to set a default password for all entries with no
password fields.

Password Gorilla v1.5.3.7, and possibly other versions, allows creating
entries with no password fields.

Password Safe for Windows v3.26, and possibly other versions, will not
create en entry with no password, it will display an error message if the
user doesn't use the password field.

PasswdSafe for Android will not create an entry with no password.

3- Missing usernames

Password Gorilla v1.5.3.7, and possibly other versions, allows creating
entries with no username fields.

Password Safe for Windows v3.26, and possibly other versions, creates
entries with no usernames with a username field composed of a blank string.

PasswdSafe for Android will create entries with no username field.

3- Password Modification Time

When Password Gorilla doesn't save a password entry, it also doesn't save
a Password Modification Time field.

PasswdSafe on Android doesn't seem to save a Password Modification Time
field.

4- Last Modification Time

PasswdSafe on Android doesn't seem to save a Last Modification Time field.
