Here are some current issues with interopability:

1- Line terminators in notes

Both Password Safe for Windows v3.31 and Password Gorilla v1.5.3.6.3 on
Ubuntu 13.04 create notes with CRLF line terminators, which Pasaffe creates
them with LF line terminators. This doesn't seem to create an issue, but
perhaps Pasaffe should make sure they are CRLF in the database, and
migrate existing entries on import.

2- Missing passwords

Pasaffe allows creating entries with no password fields. Password Gorilla
v1.5.3.6.3 on Ubuntu 13.04 has no trouble with missing password fields, but
Password Safe for Windows v3.31 gives an error dialog when opening the
database and proceeds to set a default password for all entries with no
password fields.
